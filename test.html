        <p>
          Omletts are widly regarded as a simple and easy way to cook egg. But
          among professional chefs it is a mark of pride to take simple ingrediants
          and create an amazing plate of food. the more simple the recipy the
          harder it becomese to create amazing food without technical skills and
          a deep understanding of ingrediants.

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>
              To make to perfect omelette you need to select the perfect pan. The curvature
              and height of the pan walls conducts the heat is particular ways that
              allows the egg to cook evenly and for the liquid to evaporate. By using
              a non-stick pan you are able to avoid using excess lubricant (oil, butter
              or cooking margarine) this highlights the flavour of the egg and helps
              keep them light and fluffy.

              The egg will need to be beaten before being added to the pan and
              once the egg is in the pan it will need to be stirred . There are
              many different utensils that can do this job but none are more simple
              than a fork.

            <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
              <p>
                It's a good idea to use a plastic or wooden fork so as not to
                damage the pan.

        <h4>The Eggs</h4>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>
              Not all eggs are made equal. The condition for the chickens can effect
              he flavour, like all animals when we are stressed or depressed our bodies
              generate hormones and chemicals. these chemicals can effect the way
              the egg cooks and tests. Free range organic eggs have less amounts of
              unwanted hormones and chemicals and so are the perfect main ingredient.
            </p>
            <p>
              The size of egg can result in differing cooking times and thickness
              of the finished omelette. We will be using medium size egg for consistent
              results.

        <h4>Salt</h4>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>
              Adding salt to foods helps certain molecules in those foods more easily
              release into the air, thus helping the aroma of the food, which is important
              in our perception of taste. In small amounts it also tastes pretty good.

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>
              Chives belong to the same family as onion but are more sumbele in flavour
              and aroma. Onion retains liquid and can result in a more runny omlet. The
              egg can become overcooked before the onion is to your liking. and so
              Chives are a better option to add a more complex flavour to your eggs.

          The size of the pan and amount of egg in the pan will effect the cooking

          These numbers wore reached by following istructions from frensh chef
          Jacques Pepin, who is widly regarded as a omlett master. Pepin recogmends
          using four eggs in a 24cm pan.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Step One:</h3>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          Begin by cracking four medium eggs into a mixing bowl, season them with
          salt and add a good pinhe or finly chopped chives, and, using the same fork you'll use to cook the omelette,
          beat the eggs just until no traces of visible white remain.
        </p>
        <div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
          <p>
            The yolk and whites cook at different rates so need to be fully incorporated
            to cook evenly.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          People use to belive that adding salt to egg makes the end result more
          watery. This in not inface the case, the salt reacts with the egg giving
          it a more translucent appearance that was mistaken for wateriness.
        </p>
        <img src="images/whisking.jpg" alt="four photos at differant stages of the whisking process">
      </div>
      <h3>Step Two:</h3>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          Set your pan over moderate heat and melt a tablespoon or so of butter
          in it, swirling constantly. When the butter is fully melted and foamy,
          it's hot enough. Now add the egg to the pan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take the fork now, and, with its tines up, start stirring quickly, working
          it all over the pan to break up large curds that form on the bottom.
          Simultaneously shaking the pan back and forth with your other hand helps
          keep the egg in motion while you stir—the more the egg moves around in
          the pan, the more evenly it cooks.
        </p>
        <img src="images/cooking.jpg" alt="four photos at differant stages of the cooking process">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          The key is to not scramble them to the point of forming separate curds
          that will never come back together again. Learning to find that sweet
          spot of doneness is the single most important skill in omelette-making;
          it may take a few practice runs before you get a good feel for it, but
          it's something anyone can learn. This is a case in which folks with gas
          flames have a distinct advantage over those with electric-coil or induction
          cooktops, as a gas flame will heat around the sides of the pan as well,
          making it easier to get a clean, well-defined edge to your eggs.
        </p>
        <p>
          As soon as you've hit that perfect point, stop scrambling and use your
          fork to smooth the egg out and scrape down any wispy bits around the
          edges. You can even give the pan a few taps against the cooktop to help
          settle it all down, running the fork around the edge to loosen up the
          lips of the omelette. Some chefs like to tilt the pan while the eggs
          are still quite runny, letting the bulk of the egg collect in the bottom
          curve of the pan, which creates a more extreme contrast between the
          set edge and the very soft center.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, if the egg on top of your creamy little pancake looks
          like it needs to cook a hair more, just let it linger over the flame
          an extra moment or two. Don't worry yourself too much about browning.
          While it's true that the platonic French omelette has no trace of browning
          on its surface, a little bit won't hurt. (Plus, like I said before,
          that moderate heat will ensure that the omelette doesn't brown too quickly.)
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Step Three:</h3>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          Next, tilt the pan up by the handle, and, using your fork, roll the
          omelette down in half over itself. At this point, you can move the pan
          off the heat, unless you're still trying to cook some of the egg.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the part where the pros do the fist-bump on the handle to jump
          the omelette toward the lower edge of the pan. Feel free to try that
          if you want, but don't get scared off thinking it's a necessary move.
          You can just as easily use the fork to wiggle and prod the omelette
          down into the curve of the pan. A good nonstick finish will make this
          easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try to push it far enough that the lower lip of the folded omelette
          juts out of the pan, then use your fork to push it up, closing the
          omelette.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>Step Four:</h3>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          Now push the omelette a little closer to the edge of the tilted pan,
          let the pan hover directly above a plate, and tip the pan to roll it
          out. The seam should be on the bottom, and the omelette should be almond-
          or cigar-shaped.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it doesn't look quite right, you can always use a couple of forks—or
          a clean kitchen towel, laid over the omelette—to adjust the omelette's
          shape and position on the plate.
